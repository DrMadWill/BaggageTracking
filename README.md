# Baggage Tracking

## Description
> Find out where your baggage is by searching the `flycode` on the ticket. 
**FlyCode :** A unique `id` associated with each ticket.
> Since I could not find a suitable `Api`, I used static data in the database.
## Usage
### User Uses
> When you enter the `flycode` of the ticket, the following results are returned to you.
- If the flight time of the plane is long, you will be told "Wait for the tickets to be checked." message is displayed.
- Tickets are checked and luggage is handed over 4 hours before the flight.
	-  At this time, you can go to the `Tracking Baggage` section by entering the code of your ticket.All events are pending here.
	- After the luggage is delivered, the status of your luggage is "Expected". After the luggage is loaded on the plane, it becomes "Success".
	- After the plane takes off, it lands and when the luggage is emptied, you will receive information from whichever outlet it is transferred to. And you go to that exit.
### Staff Uses
> The FlyCode of each ticket is pasted on the tickets in the form of a QR code. The QR code is sent to the relevant links through QR code readers.
#### When baggage is checked in.	
- The flight code of the baggage is sent to this link.
	- `https://baggageplane.herokuapp.com/Stuffs/BaggageTakeOver/[FlayCode]`
#### Whenever the baggage is loaded, the baggage flycode is sent here.
- `https://baggageplane.herokuapp.com/Stuffs/AirplaneLoading/[FlayCode]`
#### After the plane lands and approaches the platform, the FlyCode of the ticket is sent here.
- `https://baggageplane.herokuapp.com/Stuffs/AirplaneLanded/[FlayCode]`
#### After the luggage is unloaded from the plane, the FlyCode of the ticket is sent here.

#### When baggage is routed to the exit, the FlyCod of the ticket is transmitted to this link.
- `https://baggageplane.herokuapp.com/Stuffs/AirplaneIsOut/[FlayCode]`
#### When the baggage leaves the exit, the FlyCode of the ticket and the Id of the exit platform are transferred to this link.
